  }
}
```

### 3D Secure Setup

If you enable 3D Secure (`BRAINTREE_ENABLE_3D_SECURE=true`), you may need to make additional changes on your storefront to support 3D Secure flows. Refer to the [Braintree 3D Secure documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/3d-secure/overview/) for more details.

### Webhook Setup

To handle payment updates from Braintree, you need to configure webhooks:

1. In your Braintree dashboard, go to **Settings > Webhooks**.
2. Add a new webhook and set the URL to your Medusa server's webhook endpoint (e.g., `https://your-medusa-server.com/webhooks/braintree`).
3. Use the value of `BRAINTREE_WEBHOOK_SECRET` as the secret for validating incoming webhooks.
4. Make sure your Medusa server is configured to handle Braintree webhook events.

For more information, see the [Braintree Webhooks documentation](https://developer.paypal.com/braintree/docs/guides/webhooks/overview).

### Adding Custom Fields in the Braintree Dashboard

To ensure proper integration with Medusa, you need to add the following custom fields in your Braintree dashboard:

1. **Navigate to:**  
   `Account Settings` → `Transactions` → `Custom Fields`

2. **Add each custom field:**
   - Click the **Options** button.
   - Click the **Add** button.
   - Enter the details for each field as shown below:

| Field Name                | API Name                    | Description         | Options             |
|--------------------------|-----------------------------|---------------------|---------------------|

| Cart Id                   | `cart_id`                   | Cart Id             | Store and Pass back |
| Customer Id               | `customer_id`               | Customer Id         | Store and Pass back |
